# üß© Kanban Board App

## Description

### What is the project motivation?
This project was developed to implement a secure and private task management system that uses a Kanban board layout. It allows authenticated users to visualize and organize their tasks efficiently. The main goal was to combine user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a modern, interactive front-end experience.

### Why did you build this project?
To create a full-stack application where users can log in and access a personal or shared Kanban board. It also served as a practice project to strengthen my knowledge in authentication, protected routes, state management, and UI/UX in web applications.

### What problem does it solve?
This application solves the need for a private, easy-to-use task management tool. It ensures that only authenticated users can access or manipulate data, providing a centralized and secure solution to manage ongoing projects or to-do items.

### What did you learn?
- JWT-based authentication and secure session handling.
- Protecting API routes and frontend views based on authentication state.
- State management across components using React hooks.
- Handling forms and real-time updates in a React app.
- Creating drag-and-drop interactions for tasks in a Kanban layout.
- Structuring and deploying a full-stack app with modern tools.
